## Read-only mirror

This repository is a read-only mirror. Its public Git history contains mirror commits,
so maintainers cannot merge pull requests directly into this repository.

Public Discussions are welcome for bug reports, design feedback, documentation
problems, and feature requests. Maintainers may incorporate a proposal and publish it
through the normal mirror process, but starting a Discussion does not guarantee that a
patch will be adopted.

## Adding a command

Choose the path and verb before copying an existing command. The full rules and rationale
are in [Command grammar](docs/output-style.md#command-grammar); use this decision table for
the common choices:

| Decision | Rule |
|---|---|
| Available leaf verb | Use only `accept`, `begin`, `cancel`, `complete`, `create`, `decline`, `delete`, `disable`, `doctor`, `download`, `drain`, `enable`, `end`, `enroll`, `history`, `issue`, `leave`, `link`, `list`, `login`, `logout`, `move`, `preview`, `propose`, `reference`, `remove`, `rename`, `request`, `retire`, `retry`, `revoke`, `run`, `schema`, `seal`, `serve`, `set`, `show`, `signup`, `status`, `update`, `upload`, `validate`, `version`, `view`, or `wait`. Amend the style guide before introducing another verb; an existing command is not precedent. `detach` and `disconnect` are prohibited command verbs. |
| Print one / print many / interact | Use `show` / `list` / `view`. Use `validate`, `run`, and `retry` for those literal operations. |
| Mint an entity | Use `issue` when the immediate sibling family contains `revoke`; otherwise use `create`. |
| Change attributes | Use `rename` only when the complete mutable set is `{name}`; use `update` when two or more attributes are mutable. Never offer both in one family. |
| Sever a binding | Use `remove`, never `detach` or `disconnect`. |

Compose recurring flags from the shared argument types in `src/cli.rs`: `JsonArgs` for
`--json`, `HttpOptions` for `--allow-insecure-http`, `PrincipalAuthenticationArgs` or
`RequiredServiceAuthenticationArgs` for `--service-api-key-file`, `PaginationArgs` for
`--limit` plus `--cursor`, `WaitTimeoutArgs` for `--timeout`, and `NamedInputArgs` for
named inputs. Use `CommonArgs` wherever JSON, authentication, and HTTP policy co-occur so
their relative order remains structural. Help equality follows this semantic option
identity, not the long spelling alone: the same shared type and parameterization has the
same help, while `JsonArgs` result families, streaming JSON output, and
`PaginationArgs` bounds have their repository-owned parameterized help. If a flag will
recur and has no shared type yet, introduce one rather than declaring the flag on each
leaf.

Require `--yes` for leaves ending in `delete`, `decline`, `end`, `leave`, `remove`,
`revoke`, or `retire`, and for `account deletion request` and
`organization deletion request`; no other leaf takes it. Reversible modes such as
`runner disable` and `runner drain` do not take `--yes`.

Every `list` leaf paginates unless the API-limited exception is recorded in
[`docs/output-style.md`](docs/output-style.md). For a paginated leaf, expose
`--limit` and `--cursor` together through `PaginationArgs`, which also supplies
the exact `Pagination:` after-help from the style guide. Use its bound parameter
for a family whose maximum differs from the standard 200 items.

[`cli::grammar_tests::cli_grammar_conforms`](src/cli/grammar_tests.rs) checks command
grammar across the command tree, and
[`cli::tests::customer_command_surface_is_exact_and_has_no_operator_entrypoint`](src/cli.rs)
checks the customer command paths. The small set of `trycmd` cases under
`tests/cmd/help/` protects representative help rendering shapes, not every command's
prose. Add a snapshot only when a new rendering shape is not covered (for example, a
new kind of positional/flag layout or after-help section); update a retained case if
its rendered help changes. Prefer structural conformance checks for cross-command rules
and focused integration tests for command behavior.

## Development checks

If you inspect or modify a local copy, run the canonical check from the repository root:

```sh
./scripts/check
```

Use Devenv 2.3.1, matching the executable pinned in `.github/workflows/check.yml`.
Devenv 2.2.2's embedded Nix evaluator can intermittently fail with invalid store paths
on fresh Linux installations; upgrading only the external Nix executable does not fix
that evaluator. To run with the exact CI version without changing your profile:

```sh
nix shell github:cachix/devenv/2418e1b43797c44de5166176622c8d8fa0149871 \
  --command ./scripts/check
```

The project uses its standalone devenv environment to provide the minimum Rust toolchain
declared in `Cargo.toml` and the pinned Node 24 line used by the private PiJsonV1
extension project. `./scripts/check` enters that environment through the clean boundary
and runs the same formatting, linting, testing, source-boundary, and release packaging checks
used by CI. The canonical check performs a
locked npm install before checking the extension; run
`./scripts/check-pi-json-v1-extension` for that focused path.

Rust unit and integration tests run through cargo-nextest with the checked-in
`.config/nextest.toml` policy. Both `./scripts/check` and the production Nix package select the
locked workspace with all targets and all features. Nix injects the package version and build
identity into its complete run, which is where the injected-version contract is proved; the local
suite builds once without injection. The current workspace is binary-only and has no
documentation-test target; formatting, Clippy, and structural checks remain explicit parts of the
broader local suite rather than Nix package checks. The local suite packages and verifies the
release archive from the binary its integration tests already built rather than compiling an
optimized binary; optimized builds are produced only by the Nix package and release builds.

Nextest gives each selected test its own process, preventing a child forked by one test from
inheriting another test's open descriptors. This isolation does not prevent races among processes
created within one test, and it does not change production process behavior.

## Rust baseline upgrades

`package.rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` is the single Rust baseline declaration. Express
it as the selected stable `MAJOR.MINOR` release line. The development and MSRV
toolchains, production Nix package, and GitHub release builds derive their compiler from
that value; do not add a `rust-toolchain` file, a second version constant, or an older
compatibility build.

Advance the baseline directly when the project intentionally adopts a newer compiler or
dependency requirement. Before a bump, confirm that the release line is available from
the pinned Rust overlay and from rustup on every native release runner. Update
`Cargo.lock` only when the new baseline changes dependency resolution or when the same
change deliberately refreshes dependencies. Because the CLI is pre-release, replace the
old baseline rather than retaining parallel support.

Treat a higher source-build requirement as breaking release intent in the canonical
private journal. Validate a bump with `./scripts/check`, the monorepo dependency-state
check, and `nix flake check`; release CI builds every supported native target with the
candidate version.

## Release policy and archived notes

`release.toml` schema 2 is static policy, not mutable next-version intent. Keep its
initial version at `0.1.0`, development version at `0.0.0-dev`, and pre-1.0 breaking
impact at `minor`. Keep the Cargo fallback in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` permanently
at `0.0.0-dev`. `./scripts/check-release` validates those values, and
`./scripts/release-impact` derives a version only when given explicit impact and an
optional latest stable version.

`changes/` is a frozen legacy archive. Do not add, modify, move, or delete fragments.
New release intent is admitted through the canonical private repository's append-only
journal and is intentionally absent from this exported source tree. Public notes still
describe present-tense user behavior and must not include credentials, private URLs,
customer or incident details, premature vulnerability details, or an `internal` marker
that conceals a user-visible security fix. Run `./scripts/check-change-fragments` to
validate the complete frozen archive offline.

Managed Buildkite advances public `main` to an untagged candidate after validating the
canonical source-evidence artifact. Public Actions verifies the candidate contract with
`scripts/verify-release-candidate`, checks Linux and macOS, and builds all three native
archives before the protected `cli-release` environment asks a human to approve the
proposed version and notes. The write-scoped `scripts/reconcile-release` publishes only a
candidate that is still public `main`, accepts matching absent, direct-tag, or draft state,
and leaves an exact published release unchanged. Run
`python3 scripts/test-release-candidate` for the local Git and mocked GitHub fixture. A
pre-tag failure is repaired by advancing `main` with a corrected candidate; do not reset
the branch, move a stable tag, edit a published release, or restore allocation and recovery
state.

## Security reports

Do not report vulnerabilities, credentials, or other sensitive details in a public
Discussion. Follow `SECURITY.md` instead.
